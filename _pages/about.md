Hi, I'm Sid. I am a self-taught Web developer turned Product Leader. Most recently, I was a Product Manager at Index Coop, where I worked on Leveraged Token products. I spent most of my time at Index Coop looking at on-chain [Data](https://dune.com/index_coop). 


You can view my formal work history on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-hemrajani-36b27288/). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
